## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Question 1 part a - find the type of trees data object 

Install bioconductor

```{r}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.12")
```

Install multtest package 

```{r}
BiocManager::install(c("multtest"))
```


Import Data set
```{r}
library(multtest)
data(golub)
```


```{r}
gol.fac <- factor(golub.cl, levels=0:1, labels = c("ALL", "AML"))
gol.fac
```

Question 1 part a - compute mean expression of the values among ALL patients 
```{r}
meanAll <- apply(golub[,gol.fac=="ALL"], 1, mean)
```

Question 1 part b - compute the mean expression of the values among AML patients 

```{r}
meanAML <- apply(golub[,gol.fac=="AML"], 1, mean)
```

Question 1 part c - output top three mean values for ALL data

```{r}
orderAll<-order(meanAll, decreasing = TRUE)
print(golub.gnames[orderAll[1:3],2])
```

Question 1 part d - output top three mean values for AML data 

```{r}
orderAML<-order(meanAML, decreasing = TRUE)
print(golub.gnames[orderAML[1:3],2])
```
Question 2 part a - save the expression values of the first five genes (of first five rows) for AML patients in a csv file

```{r}
orderGenesAML<-order(gol.fac=="AML", decreasing = TRUE)
write.csv(golub.gnames[orderGenesAML[1:5],2], "AML5.csv")
```

Question 2 part b - save the expression values of the first five genes (of first five rows) for ALL patients in a text file 

```{r}
orderGenesALL<-order(gol.fac=="ALL", decreasing = TRUE)
write.table(golub.gnames[orderGenesALL[1:5],2], "ALL5.txt")
```

Question 2 part c - compute the stdev of the expression values on the first patient of the 100th to 200th genes 

```{r}
sd(golub[100:200,1])
```

Question 2 part d - compute the stdev of the expression values of every gene, across all patients - find the # of genes with stdev greater than 1

```{r}
sum(apply(golub, 1, sd) > 1)
```

Question 2 part e - Create a scatter plot of the 101th gene expressions against the 102th gene expressions, label the x-axis and the y-axis with genes biological names using xlab and ylab

```{r}
plot(golub[101,], golub[102,], xlab = "101th Gene expression", ylab = "102th Gene Expression", main = paste(golub.gnames[101,2], "vs" , golub.gnames[102,2]))
```


Question 3 
```{r}
BiocManager::install("ALL")
```
```{r}
library("ALL")
data(ALL)
```

Question 3 part a - Produce a histogram of gene expressions in the matrix 

```{r}
B1 = exprs(ALL[,ALL$BT=="B1"])
hist(B1)
```
```{r include=FALSE}
apply(exprs(ALL[,ALL$BT=="B1"]), 1, mean)
```

Question 3 part c - give the gene identifiers of the three genes with the largest mean value 

```{r}
names(sort(apply(exprs(ALL[,ALL$BT=="B1"]), 1, mean), decreasing = TRUE)[1:3])
```


Question 4 part a

Trees object is of type data frame 

```{r}
# find the type of the trees data object 
data(trees)
class(trees)
```
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

```
Question 4 part b - produce an overlaid figure of the two scatter plots above 

```{r}
plot(trees$Girth, trees$Height, pch = "+", col = "blue", 
     ylim = c(min(c(trees$Height, trees$Volume)), max(c(trees$Height, trees$Volume))),
     main = "Tree Girth vs Height/Volume")
points(trees$Girth, trees$Volume, pch = "o", col = "red")
legend("bottomright", 
       legend = c("Height (feet)", "Volume (cu feet)"),
       pch = c("+", "o"),
       col = c("blue", "red"))
```
